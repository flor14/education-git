### How this information could be useful for an educator?

Are you using the material to teach undergrad students with no background in computer sciences? Are you training scientists? Would you like to reinforce a topic with more activities but you don't have time to create new ones? Here you can find a selection of activities that you can use.
Part of this website's material could be used, for example, to complement a The Carpentries lesson for the specific needs of the course you are teaching.

I came up with this idea as I was redeveloping a course for the Master of Data Science Program at the University of British Columbia, where I am currently working in a postdoc position. 

### Can I learn Git and GitHub from this website?

Well, it was not my original purpose. There are many good tutorials and courses that you can explore for free, such as The Carpentries course. 

### Does you making this website mean that you're an amazing instructor?

Lol, no. Being a good instructor involves far more than knowing what you should be teaching. Educators are like wine, they mature with the time and experience.
But, I hope that reflecting on this can get us all a little further along in our journeys to becoming the best instructors we can be.

### What is next?

I will update this website from time to time with the goal of providing material towards an advanced teaching course I'd like to create in the future.
